# Test Plan

## Project Overview
This test plan outlines the approach for automating test cases for the **Sauce Demo** website using Selenium. The goal is to validate key functionalities of the website, including user authentication, product management, and checkout processes, ensuring that the site performs as expected under various scenarios.

## Scope
The scope of this testing includes:

- User login/logout functionality.
- Product interactions, such as adding/removing items from the cart.
- Navigation and display of product details.
- Checkout process, including payment and order confirmation.
- Sorting and filtering of products.

## Test Objectives
- Ensure the integrity of the user authentication process.
- Validate that the cart functionality operates correctly across sessions.
- Confirm that products can be viewed, sorted, filtered, and managed in the cart.
- Verify the checkout process from cart review to order confirmation.

## Testing Tools
- **Selenium** for automation.
- **TestNG** for test management and reporting.

## Assumptions
- The website is stable and available for testing.
- Valid user credentials are available for testing.

## Deliverables
- Automated test scripts for the identified test cases.
- A report summarizing test results, including pass/fail status for each test case.

## Test Execution
The tests will be executed locally and can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing. The results will be analyzed, and any defects found will be reported for further investigation.
